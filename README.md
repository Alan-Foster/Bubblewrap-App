# Bubblewrap

A simple game that users can play by clicking bubble icons in a grid. 
Originally a copypasta comment minigame made from combining spoilers, 
this uses Custom Posts for the same effect.

The primary purpose of this app is not for entertainment, but for education. 
This app is part of an ongoing video series showcasing how apps can be created on the Reddit Developer Platform.
If I can build an app like this, so can you!
